# Summary

UD Tatar-NMCTT is a manually annotated corpus of the Tatar language based on the text from Tatar-Inform (tatar-inform.tatar),
an online news website.


# Introduction

UD Tatar-NMCTT is a corpus of the Tatar language, manually annotated by Chihiro Taguchi
under the project "NAIST Multilingual Corpus" at Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.
The text is taken from the online news website Tatar-Inform.
The articles contain a wide variety of genres, including politics, health, incidents, etc.
